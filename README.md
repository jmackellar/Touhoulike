Touhoulike
==========

Touhoulike is a large open world Roguelike based on the Touhou project.  Set in Gensokyo, players take up the role of Reimu Hakurei and her sworn duty to exterminate youkai.  Visiting various randomly generated and premade dungeons spread across the land, the player powers up and prepares to face the ultimate unknown evil.

This game is made using the wonderful Love2D framework, and as such requires a few steps in order to run.  

1. Install a copy of Love2D 0.8.0 from love2d.org

2. Zip all game files together as you found them, making sure that main.lua is in the parent directory

3. Rename the file from *.zip to *.love

4. Enjoy!

If the game runs slow for you, try instead using the LuaJIT version of Love2D.  If that still doesn't work, then maybe you need a computer upgrade!
